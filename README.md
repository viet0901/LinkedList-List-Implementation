# List Class Implementation in C++

## Purpose
This project contains the implementation of a `List` class in C++ that represents a singly linked list. The class provides various methods to manipulate and access the list, including adding, inserting, removing, and accessing elements. It also includes utility functions such as calculating the length of the list and checking if it's empty. The implementation demonstrates fundamental linked list operations and memory management in C++.

## Features
- **Dynamic Memory Management:** The list dynamically allocates and deallocates memory as needed, using constructors, destructors, and assignment operators.
- **Core Operations:**
  - `append`: Adds an item to the end of the list.
  - `insert`: Inserts an item at a specified position.
  - `remove`: Removes an item from the list at a given index.
  - `operator[]`: Accesses an item at a specified index.
  - `length`: Returns the number of elements in the list.
  - `isEmpty`: Checks if the list is empty.
  - `clear`: Removes all elements from the list.
  - `operator+`: Concatenates two lists into a new list.

## Setup Instructions
To use the `List` class, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure you have a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
3. Compile the source code:
    ```bash
    g++ -o ListProgram main.cpp List.cpp
    ```
4. Run the program:
    ```bash
    ./ListProgram
    ```
